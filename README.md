# Mobile


A mobile application with which I can keep track of my watched movies.
When I am adding a movie into the application, I can specify the title, director and genre(s). Furthermore, I can specify a personal rating and add a review to the movie. A timestamp will be added automatically in order to have an idea regarding the visualisation of the movie. 
The design is made for my liking, which is colourful, a bit eyesore and stupid.

<h4> Assesment Plan </h4>
<br/>

<ul>
  <li> Laboratory 1 <p> ProjectIdea </p></li>
  <li> Laboratory 2 <p> CrudProject - UI only - Native

    Each CRUD operation should have its own screen.
    You should be able to demo all CRUD operations, using fake/in-memory data.
    Either Android (Java/Kotlin) or iOS (Objective-C/Swift) should be used. 
    
  <i>I picked kotlin, android.</i>
  </p>
</li>
     <li> Laboratory 3 <p>CrudProject - UI only - NonNative

    Each CRUD operation should have its own screen.
    You should be able to demo all CRUD operations, using fake/in-memory data.
    Either of Flutter, React-Native, NativeScript, or Any other mobile multi-platform framework.
    
   <i>I picked react-native, #TODO.</i>
  </p>
</ul>
